    <p className="testimonialsDescription">“Excellent civil engineering firm I&#39;ve worked with many times throughout the past seven years, specifically on
residential development needs of contractors/builders and individuals I do arboricultural and project
management/consulting work for. As a daughter of a FHWA civil engineer, I understand the absolute
importance of this role within every project (large or small) I undertake. </p>
<p className="testimonialsDescription">
I have referred many clients to Eastside and have brought them onboard directly in my role as project
manager on my most challenging missions. I trust them and have enjoyed a great working partnership helping
me achieve my clients&#39; objectives with their experience and expertise in Civil Engineering AND their solid
working relationships with various municipalities.</p>
<p className="testimonialsDescription">
From their principal (Ron) to my lead civil engineer, Jerin (working a current, extremely challenging project
with me) to Kristy (office guru/front person extraordinaire) and their wonderful survey team who I ask a lot of
in oft inhospitable terrain and inclement weather.</p>
<p className="testimonialsDescription">
I recommend Eastside Consulting wholeheartedly!” </p>

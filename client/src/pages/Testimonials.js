    <h5 className="testimonialsTitle"> Kristin T. </h5>
    <p className="testimonialsDescription">“Excellent civil engineering firm I&#39;ve worked with many times throughout the past seven years, specifically on
residential development needs of contractors/builders and individuals I do arboricultural and project
management/consulting work for. As a daughter of a FHWA civil engineer, I understand the absolute
importance of this role within every project (large or small) I undertake. </p>
<p className="testimonialsDescription">
I have referred many clients to Eastside and have brought them onboard directly in my role as project
manager on my most challenging missions. I trust them and have enjoyed a great working partnership helping
me achieve my clients&#39; objectives with their experience and expertise in Civil Engineering AND their solid
working relationships with various municipalities.</p>
<p className="testimonialsDescription">
From their principal (Ron) to my lead civil engineer, Jerin (working a current, extremely challenging project
with me) to Kristy (office guru/front person extraordinaire) and their wonderful survey team who I ask a lot of
in oft inhospitable terrain and inclement weather. I recommend Eastside Consulting wholeheartedly!” </p>

<p className="testimonialsDescription"> “Rob and team were great to work with over the past several years....reasonable charges and reasonable
people!” </p>




<h5 className="testimonialsTitle"> Mike A. </h5>

<h5 className="testimonialsTitle"> Dave S. </h5>
<p className="testimonialsDescription"> “Excellent engineering firm been working with Rob for years!”</p>



<h5 className="testimonialsTitle"> Brad S. </h5>
<p className="testimonialsDescription">
“Sharp, professional and honest. I had a lot line question and they patiently laid out my options, even those that didn&#39;t include their services.
Ultimately, I decided to not use their services because it would have been overkill for my situation. But I really
appreciated their willingness to give honest advice even if it might cost them a job. If I ever need a surveyor, I&#39;ll talk with these folks first.” </p>
